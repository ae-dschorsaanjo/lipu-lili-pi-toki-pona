This grammar description and dictionary describes how I use this language and what are my principles. It was not meant to be a lesson of any kind, but I can see the potential in it as a "brief" summary about the language, or like a cheat sheet (though it is too long for that purpose).

I make a difference between _formal_ and _informal_ use of the language.

# Definitions

Here I list every definition that can be misunderstood.

## Dialect

A variant of toki pona.

## Ambiguity

It does not mean how ambiguous a sentence is in English (or in any translation), but how a sentence can be transcribe between dialects (e.g. the name "tok' apona" is "toki pi pona ala" in _pu_ dialect, not "toki pona ala").

## Formal use

This is the use of the language in larger groups, forums and in any place outside of a small community. In those, people probably learned the language from various sources, lessons, so it is important to use more strict rules to make less ambiguity.

## Informal use

This is the use of the language in small groups, chats, and in literature and music (poems, lyrics, raps). It is probably less strict than the _formal use_, though it also has or should have its well defined rule set. My informal use is based on [tok' apona](https://github.com/ae-dschorsaanjo/tok-apona), although it changed a bit since that.

## Usually, usual use

These are referring to how words are used and defined in _pu_. This meaning is not used in the [dictionary](#as-i-use)!

## Sins and lesser sins

These are (bad) habits and widespread use of words that I do not agree with. Some of these may be in other sets of lessons. Some of these may be "legalized" in _informal use_.

The _lesser sins_ are either more widespread (hence less preventable), or sort of close to the usual use of toki pona, but against rules or in an undefined gray zone.

# Formal use

The grammar is mostly based on _pu_ dialect, extended by a few structures and use of prepositions from _jan Pije's lessons_ and _common use_ of the language. The words' meanings can be different than they are in _pu_, but mostly they are extended and not changed.

## Word order

The word order is SVO (subject-verb-object) or SlVeO (subject-_li_-verb-_e_-object), and prepositions are after the object. The _usual prepositions_ (kepeken, lon, tawa) though can be placed right after the subject (but _before li_), with an additional comma before them if necessary. Adjectives, adverbs and possessive is _after_ the noun or verb!

## Punctuation

### Commas

The commas have _no grammatical meaning_, they are only helps to interpret written sentences. These are optional. I often use commas in the following cases and places:

- _before la_, if there is a full sentence before it (mi moku, la mi pilin pona);
- _before o_, if it is an imperative sentences that includes subject (sina, o pali!);
- _after o_, if it is an interjection or a phrase, and there is a subject (sina o, pona!);
- _before prepositions_, if it is not obvious that the word is a preposition or an adjective (ona li tomo tawa mi), or it is not a preposition by _pu_ (ona li tawa, poka mi).

And I do not use comma _before taso when it is a conjunction_. I think it is a much more pona way to end the sentence with a period and start the next one with taso (ona li pona. taso ona li ike lukin).

### Exclamation marks

I use exclamation marks in

- imperative sentences (o moku!),
- interjections (moku pona!), and
- after regular, but somehow emphasized sentences (mi wile moku! ona li suli a!).

In both imperatives and interjections the subject is _optional_.

### Quotes

Use _"_ always for quotes to avoid ambiguity with shortenings (where _apostrophes_ `'` are used).

### Dialog

This is how I write a dialog:

- Quotation marks, if it is an _inline direct dialog_;
- En-dash `–` or two hyphens `--`, if the direct dialog _begins after line break_, or after an _inline indirect dialog_;
- En-dash `–` or two hyphens `--`, if the direct dialog _followed by an indirect dialog_.

__Example:__

ona li toki e ni: "mi wile tawa weka!" mi sona e ni: jan li apeja e ona.  
-- mi pilin e ni: sina wile pini e toki kalama. sina sona e ni: mi kepeken sina. jan li wile apeja e sina, la jan li wile utala e mi! -- mi toki tawa ona.  
-- pona! mi sona e ni. taso mi pilin monsuta. -- oko ona li telo. -- mi ken pali e seme?  
-- mi sona ala. ike mi.  
-- o nasa ala! sina ike ala.

## Prepositions

The _usual or traditional prepositions_ are _kepeken_, _lon_ and _tawa_. The words _tan_ and _sama_ often used as prepositions (and _pu_ also defines them so), and sometimes also the words for directions.

### kepeken

The usual meanings are _with_ and _use_. Usually it should __never__ be a verb (if so, it means _use_ as a verb and _with_ as a preposition).

### lon

The usual meaning is _located in/on/at_, and _existing_ as an adjective. It usually does not used as a verb, but it could be with the meaning _place in/on_ or _put into/onto/_. lon can also mark _time_ ("lon tenpo ni" -- now), though using a _la structure_ is recommended.

### tawa

The usual meanings are _moving to, going to_ and _for, to_. As an adjective it also is means _moving_, and as a verb it is often used for saying _move something_.

### tan

Usually it means _by, from, because of_ as a preposition. It also can mean _reason_ as a noun and _cause_ as a verb.

### sama

The usual meanings are fine (see in the [dictionary](#as-i-use)).

### Direction words

With the usual use, these (_sinpin, sewi, anpa, insa, poka_ and _monsi_) are _after a preposition_ (lon or tawa) and there is a "pi" after these, if it is followed by more than one word, or has a modifier. It is an often seen practice, that these are used as preposition (especially _poka_ for historical reasons); if you use them like this, put a comma before them.

## pi

pi makes us able to express more complex and abstract thoughts. It changes the way how a series of words are interpreted. For example, _tomo tawa suli mute_ means literally "many big moving house", i.e. "many big cars". By adding a pi, it becomes _tomo tawa pi suli mute_ (very big car) or _tomo pi tawa suli mute_ (many big-moving house -- better translation is welcomed).

In the usual way though you cannot say _it is mine_. With a minor trick, it is easily expressible like _ona li pi mi_.

In many lessons pi is used only if there are more than one word after it. I recommend to use pi if it marks _possession_ ("ona li tomo pi mi", "ni li tomo pi jan pona").  
Note: the possessor should be _after_ the modifiers!

It is also often used to express _about_ (mostly along with ijo: _mi sitelen e ijo pi mi_ -- I write about myself).

pi is also used instead of _relative clauses_ sometimes (mi lukin e jan pi moku e kala -- I see a man who eats a fish). I always recommend to use _pi li_ instead. It can be used after either the subject or the object.  
For (a ridiculous) example: _ona pi li moku e kala li olin e jan pi li moku e kili._ -- They, whom eat a fish, love people, whom eat fruits.

## li

li is used always, unless the subject is only _mi_ or _sina_ (hence "mi moku", but "mi kin li moku").

## la

la is a separator: it separates the context (or the time) and the main sentence. The context is usually a condition or _ken la..._. The _context_ does not have to be a full sentence (e.g. "sina la ni li jan pona" -- for you, there is a friend). If the _context_ is a full sentence, then the _la_ structure means _if/then_ or _when/then_ (mi moku, la mi pilin pona).

Some words before _la_ has special meaning if they are alone. The most often seen example is "ken". These meanings will be shown in the _dictionary_.

Multiple la is also possible, then the main sentence is the _last one_ (e.g. "tenpo ni la mi wile, la mi moku.", "mi lon tomo mi, la sina ken toki, la mi tu li ken toki.")

## Questions

There are _four ways_ to make a question:
1. repeat the _verb_, _preposition_ or _pre-verb before the verb_ and put an _ala_ between them (sina wile ala wile moku?);
2. put "anu seme" to the end of the sentence (sina wile moku anu seme?);
3. put an "anu" into the sentence and mark it with a question mark that it is a question (sina wile moku anu musi?);
4. use "seme" as the subject or the object (sina wile moku e seme?).

### Answering a yes/no question

To answer of a yes/no question, _repeat the verb_ of the question (with or without the subject) to say "yes", and _say "ala"_ or _repeat the verb (with or without the subject) with "ala"_ to say "no".

## Time

These are the _tenpo X la..._ sentences. Time also can be expressed after _lon_. I use the followings for time:

- _tenpo pini:_ past,
- _tenpo ni:_ current,
- _tenpo kama:_ future,
- _tenpo suno:_ daytime,
- _tenpo pimeja:_ night,
- _tenpo pali:_ weekday,
- _tenpo sike suno:_ year,
- _tenpo mute:_ often, many times,
- _tenpo pi mute lili:_ sometimes,
- _tenpo (pi) kama lili:_ in near future,
- _tenpo (pi) suno pini:_ yesterday,
- _tenpo kin:_ again,
- etc (by the same scheme).

## Numbers

Numbers are _rarely used_ in the language. In most of the time, this _simple version_ is used (for amounts):
- __ala__ for _0_,
- __wan__ for _1_,
- __tu__ for _2_,
- __mute__ for _3+_ or _plural_ (unknown amount, but more than 1), and
- __ale__ for _every_ or _countless amount_.

There is also a bit more complex way:
- __ala__ for _0_,
- __wan__ for _1_,
- __tu__ for _2_,
- __luka__ for _5_,
- __mute__ for _20_, and
- __ale__ for _100_.

These ways can be extended with the deprecated __tuli__ (3) and __po__ (4).

For _ordinal numbers_, put the word "nanpa" before the number. In this case, "pi" is not used before "nanpa"!

## Conjunctions

With exception of _taso_, no one of these should start a sentence (use _la structures_ instead).

### And

And is expressed in _three ways_, depending on where we want to say it:
1. if it is _between subjects_, use _en_;
2. if it is _between verbs_, use _li_;
3. if it is _between objects_, use _e_.

For example, _sina en mi li wile pali li pali e ijo e ijo ante._

As a contraction, it can be _between modifiers_ too, when two different kind of thing is expressed (jan pona en toki = jan pona en jan toki = good and talking people).

### Or

This is expressed by _anu_. It can be used between either _subjects_, _verbs_ or _objects_ ("sina anu mi li pali", "sina wile anu pali", "sina pali e ijo anu ijo ante").

### But

_taso_ is the word you need. I always end the sentence with a period before it (_mi wile pali. taso sina pali_, not like _mi wile pali, taso sina pali_). Although if I want to express _exception_, then use _and_ and _negative_ (mi wile e ale e ike ala)

## Difference between a/kin, lukin/oko and namako/sin

These words became merged in _pu_. As most of the speakers, I use them differently:

- _a_ makes a word _emotionally emphasized_ or _exaggerated_, while _kin_ is for _confirmation_ and used as _also_;
- _oko_ means _eye_, all the other is _lukin_;
- _namako_ means _extra, bonus_ and sin means _new, fresh_.

The definitions above are not full: for the detailed definitions, see the _dictionary_. 

## Unofficial words

These are usually used only as adjectives. While I do not break the rule, I use them without directly putting the noun right before: _nimi mi li Sotan_ -- it is obvious that Sotan is my name. For personal names _do not_ use official words (jan Kala, jan Ko...)!

## Deprecated words

With the exception of the most known deprecated words (_monsuta_ and _kipisi_), it is recommended to use only official ones _in formal use_. Though I do not think that using deprecated (or even planned) words is a sin, if they _were not replaced_ (e.g. 'powe' and 'pake' have no obvious counterparts) or _not numbers_ ('tuli', 'po').

## Colors

Many use _laso_ for _blue_ and _green_. I use _laso_ for _blue_ only, and _kule kasi_ for green.

# Informal use

The informal use of mine is heavily based on my dialect, [tok' apona](https://github.com/ae-dschorsaanjo/tok-apona). Every informal use is optional, and to be avoided in formal use!

## Shortenings

Every word that is _longer than three letters_ can be shortened, especially if a word's last vowel is the same as the following word's first letter, as far as the word is clearly recognizable. If a _three long word_ seems to be shortened, that it signs that the _vowel is nasal_. This is marked by an _apostrophe!_

## Contractions

The contractions are unmarked, unless it says otherwise.

### Pronouns

_mi_ and _sina_ became _-mi_ and _-na_ suffixes after _verbs and prepositions_, and _ona_ became _o'_ _before verbs, prepositions, pi li_ and _pli_ (wilemi, wilena, o' li wile)

_sina_ can shorten to _-na_ even _after pi_ (...pi 'na).

### ala

This can be shortened to _a-_ or _al-_ prefix (depends on whether the word-to-be-negated starts with a vowel or a consonant). It can negate _verbs_, _prepositions_, _nouns_ and _adjectives_. The word-to-be-negated cannot start with an _a_! (awile, alunpa) If there are only the negated adjective and ala after a noun, the use of "pi" is unnecessary (hence, "tok' apona" instead of "toki pi apona").

### li

This can be shortened to _l'_ before the predicate (especially if it _begins with a vowel_). It can be done if the predicate begins, or the subject ends with a _vowel_. It can take one of these two position:
1. before the predicate as a _prefix_, if it begins with a _vowel_ (l'olin),
2. after the subject as a _postfix_, if the predicate begins with a _consonant_ (lawal' toki).

Shortening the _li_ before a _shortened ala_ is not recommended (too similar to _la_; you should not do it, unless you want to increase ambiguity), but shortening it before (a not shortened) ala is fine.

As a special case, _pi li_ can be shortened to _pli_.

### X ni

In X ni structures (where X can be a preposition or the e particle), the _ni_ can be elided, and without ending the sentence, the text (i.e. the next sentence) continues.

For example: _mi sona e ni: monsuta li lon ala_ becomes _mi sona e monsuta li lon ala._

### Assimilations

A _preposition's_ or a _verb's terminal 'n'_ can be assimilated to the following noun's or subject-suffix's 'n' or 'm' ("tammi" from "tan mi" and "lomma" from "lon ma").

### oke

It can be used as a _general approval_ or like _okay in English_.

### Use of non-proper names as unofficial words

Often and internationally used words (the Internet for example) are also can be used as unofficial word.

# Sins

These are unforgivable habits that have to end.

## Using "tawa" like it was in English

Sometimes we can see sentences like "sina wile moku tawa pilin pona" (you have to eat for feeling good) or "ona li pali tawa kama jo e ijo" (he works for getting something). It is __toki pona and not English__. Do not do this. Just do not.

### Alternatives

Use a _la_ structure (ona li pali, la ona li ken kama jo e ijo, lon tenpo kama), or use _ni:_ after the preposition and _a subject_ in the following sentence (sina moku tan ni: sina wile pilin pona).

## Using "en" and "anu" at the beginning of a sentence

Starting a sentence with _en_ or _anu_ is wrong. It is against every rule.

### Alternatives

Use _kin la_ instead of "en", and _ante la_ instead of "anu".

# Lesser sins

These are widespread use of words that cannot be prevented anymore (since these in lessons or were official in the past).

## kepeken e

jan Pije's and others', mostly older lessons use "kepeken e" to express the verb _use_. In my opinion it is unnecessary and only gives headache to many people. In most of the cases it is obvious whether one wants to say "use" or "with".

### Alternative

_Drop the e!_

## Shortening "jan" to "j-" prefix

It is a new phenomenon and seems to be spreading. There is no real problem with it in informal use, but in formal use it is ugly.

### Alternative

Do not be lazy and write _jan Sotan_ instead of _jSotan_. Thank you.

# Dictionaries

## pu

You can check the dictionary that was published in _pu_ on [this site](http://tokipona.net/tp/janpije/dictionary.php). See country names [here](http://tokipona.net/tp/janpije/placenames.php).

## As I use

These are the word definitions, based on how I use them. Widespread alternative meanings will be also described (marked with _alt_): these alternate meanings does not wrong, though in most cases I do not prefer to use them. It also includes deprecated, joke and replaced words (marked with an _asterics_). The shortened part of speech's meanings will be below the dictionary. See the shortenings of part of speeches [here](#shortenings-1)!  
I use the country names as they are in _pu_.

Some replaced words that's meaning is not unique will be separated.

There are three couple of words that are merged in _pu_ ("a/kin", "lukin/oko", "namako/sin"). Many people use them interchangeably; I do not. The definitions will be written under them as under every other word, but I will not mark the alternate meanings, I only left a _see also_ note.

## Phrases, interjections

Some of them may not be understood at first by other speakers. The word _jan_ marks the subject (or the noun of direct adress): it can be either _a name (jan X)_ or _sina_. The subject is always at the beginning of the sentence!

_(jan o,) toki!_ -- Hello!  
_mi tawa!_ -- See ya! (said by who comes)  
_(jan o,) tawa pona!_ -- Good bye! (said by who stays)

_(jan o,) pona (mute)!_ -- thank you, thanks  
_(jan o,) pona tawa sina!_ -- you're welcome 

_ike mi_ -- my fault, sorry

_ni/ona li ala_ -- it's nothing, never mind, it doesn't matter

_ale-ali_ -- either way, same thing

_(jan o,) pakala!_ -- screw you!

_ni li..._ -- there is...

_X li pona/ tawa mi_ -- I like/don't like X

_se'?_ -- wut?

### Others

_jan li moku e palisa moli._ -- X is smoking a cigarette.

### Acronyms

These are mostly used in some chat groups and are not well known (with the exception of _tp_).

_tp_ -- toki pona (mostly used in English texts)  
_ptm_ -- pona tawa mi (I like... -- Subject shall be used!)  
_omem_ -- o moli e mi (kill me now)  
_tnp_ -- tenpo (mostly to say hours, e.g. 10tnp for 10 o'clock -- 24 hour format should be used)
