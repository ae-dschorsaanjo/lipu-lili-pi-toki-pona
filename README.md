> **tl;dr** This grammar description and dictionary shows how I use this language and what are my principles. It was not meant to be a lesson of any kind, but I can see the potential in it as a "brief" summary about the language, or like a cheat sheet. I would recommend checking out the [table of contents](#table-of-contents) first.

This doc is basically a brief-ish, but almost complete description of the _toki pona grammar_ (that happened to come along with a dictionary as well) that is based on _how I use the language_. This doc is intended to those who has a basic understanding on the language, or interested in how others interpret it.

Most people will use toki pona according to [pu](http://tokipona.org/) or jan Pije's [o kama sona e toki pona!](http://tokipona.net/tp/janpije/okamasona.php). These are great sources and I wish not to compete with them... except that I kind of do. Many people learn from different sources that describes toki pona slightly differently and, for the sake of simplicity, I will call these variations _dialects_. Those differences are often minute and arguably identical to pu (depending on how one interprets pu), which was my goal as well when I first wrote this _nasin_.

Why _nasin pi jan Sotan_? Because I want to make it clear that it is, in fact, describes toki pona as a language in a way that in practice most people will not have any problem with it,but there are fundamental differences between some of the structures and the "logic behind the language" that may make it different. Just a quick example, the particles _e_ and _li_ were (and sometimes still are) a matter of debate whether they are independent words, separators between or parts of the noun/verb/subject/object, etc. I have my own view on them, others have different ones and, in the end, maybe every one of us is right, since _pu_ did not gave us a definite answer -- it only says that they are particles and _this_ and _that_ are what they do. Let us not mention the issues with _pi_ -- with little to no stretch, we (many toki pona enthusiasts and I) could write pages on this subject alone; it's different uses, alternative interpretations, other's views on it, what rules do or should apply to it, etc.
Also, I needed a name that uniquely identifies this document.

Lastly, I would like to point out that unlike many "proper" grammar descriptions, many sentences begin with "I" instead of using passive. This is because originally this document was only to present "how _I_ use the language", rather than "this is how the language should be used". While technically this is still true (as of 05/05/2019), in the future I would expand this doc and change ("properize") its language.

## Table of Contents

The order shows how this is supposed to be read.

- [Definitions](definitions.md) -- describes my use of terms and different-than-usual word uses (e.g. "usually" means "by pu" and what _sins_ are)
- [Grammar](grammar.md) -- describes the toki pona grammar (may not be beginner friendly)
- [Dictionary](dictionary.md) -- a complete toki pona dictionary, including words that are not official anymore
- [tok' apona](informal.md) -- a rather crazy toki pona dialect for informal uses (**DO NOT** use toki pona like this in general toki pona groups!)
