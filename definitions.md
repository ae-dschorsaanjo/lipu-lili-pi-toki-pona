# Definitions

Here I list every definition that I use and can (probably will) be misunderstood.

- [Dialect](#dialect)
- [Ambiguity](#ambiguity)
- [Formal use](#formal-use)
- [Informal use](#informal-use)
- [Usually, usual use](#usually-usual-use)
- [Modifier](#modifier)
- [Sins and lesser sins](#sins-and-lesser-sins)

## Dialect

A variant of toki pona, despite how similar it is to _pu_.

## Ambiguity

It does not mean how ambiguous a sentence is in English (or in any translation), but how a sentence can be transcribed between dialects (e.g. the name "tok' apona" is "toki pi pona ala" in _pu_ dialect, not "toki pona ala" -- this is a bad example, and mostly matters only for purposely non-standard toki pona dialects).

## Formal use

This is the use of the language in larger groups, forums and in any place outside of a small community. In those, people probably learned the language from various sources, lessons, so it is important to use more strict rules to make less ambiguity.

In other words, this is _proper_ toki pona and this is how toki pona should be used.

## Informal use

This is the use of the language in small groups, chats, and in literature and music (poems, lyrics, raps). It is probably less strict than the _formal use_, though it also has or should have its well defined rule set. My informal use is based on [tok' apona](https://github.com/ae-dschorsaanjo/tok-apona), although it have changed since its publication.

This is described in detail in [informal.md](informal.md).

## Usually, usual use

These are referring to how words are used and defined in _pu_. This meaning is not used in the [dictionary](dictionary.md)!

## Modifier

I use the word _modifier_ as an umbrella term for _adjectives and adverbs_, and quite often used interchangeably with _adjective_ as well.

## Sins and lesser sins

These are (bad) habits and widespread use of words that I do not agree with. Some of these may be in other sets of lessons. Some of these may be "legalized" in _informal use_.

The _lesser sins_ are either more widespread (hence less preventable), or sort of close to the usual use of toki pona, but against rules or in an undefined gray zone.

These are defined at the end of the [grammar](grammar.md).
