# Definitions

Here I list every definition that I use and can (probably will) be misunderstood.

* [Definitions](#definitions)
  * [pu](#pu)
  * [pona](#pona)
  * [Dialect](#dialect)
  * [Usually, usual](#usually-usual)
  * [Modifier](#modifier)
  * [Particle](#particle)
  * [Ambiguous, ambiguity](#ambiguous-ambiguity)
  * [Formal use](#formal-use)
  * [Gray area, gray zone](#gray-area-gray-zone)
  * [Informal use](#informal-use)
  * [Sins and lesser sins](#sins-and-lesser-sins)

## pu
 
The definition of the word is _interacting with the official Toki Pona book_\[sic\], but as a noun it refers to the book itself.

## pona

_pona_ means _good_ (among others). When such phrases used as _pona way_ and _more pona_, it means that it fits better the language.  
These sentences often describe personal interpretations and opinion.

## Dialect

A variant of toki pona, despite how similar it is to _pu_.

## Usually, usual

These are referring to how words are used and defined in _pu_. This meaning is not used in the [dictionary](dictionary.md)!

## Modifier

I use the word _modifier_ as an umbrella term for _adjectives and adverbs_, and quite often used interchangeably with _adjective_ as well (i.e. everything that changes or modifies the meaning of a noun or noun phrase).

## Particle

Particles are either _function words_ (that have only grammatical function) or _other words_ (that cannot be assigned to other parts of speech).

## Ambiguous, ambiguity

It does not mean how ambiguous a sentence is in English (or in any translation), but how a sentence can be transcribed between dialects (e.g. the name "tok' apona" is "toki pi pona ala" in _pu_ dialect, not "toki pona ala" -- this is a bad example, and mostly matters only for purposely non-standard toki pona dialects).

## Formal use

This is the use of the language in larger groups, forums and in any place outside of a small community. In those, people probably learned the language from various sources, lessons, so it is important to use more strict rules to create less ambiguity.

In other words, this is _proper_ toki pona and this is how toki pona should be used.

## Gray area, gray zone

Everything falls into the gray area that are often challenged by speakers of the language whether something is correct or not.

You should try to avoid using structures things that fall into the gray area, unless the audience is familiar with them and accept its use.

## Informal use

This is the use of the language in small groups, chats, and in literature and music (poems, lyrics, raps). It is probably less strict than the _formal use_, though it also has or should have its well defined rule set. My informal use is based on [tok' apona](https://github.com/ae-dschorsaanjo/tok-apona), although it have changed since its publication.

This is described in detail in [informal.md](informal.md).

## Sins and lesser sins

These are (bad) habits and widespread use of words that I do not agree with. Some of these may be in other sets of lessons. Some of these may be "legalized" in _informal use_.

The _lesser sins_ are either more widespread (hence less preventable), or sort of close to the usual use of toki pona, but against rules or in an undefined gray zone.

These are defined at the end of the [grammar](grammar.md).
