# tok' apona

This dialect of toki pona is heavily based on my previous attemt to write a dialect, called [tok' apona](https://github.com/ae-dschorsaanjo/tok-apona) (that repository is still online for historical reasons, it will not be updated anymore). Every informal use is optional, and to be avoided in formal use!

## Shortenings

Every word that is _longer than three letters_ can be shortened, especially if a word's last vowel is the same as the following word's first letter, as far as the word is clearly recognizable. If a _three long word_ seems to be shortened, that it signs that the _vowel is nasal_. This is marked by an _apostrophe!_

## Contractions

The contractions are unmarked, unless it says otherwise.

### Pronouns

_mi_ and _sina_ became _-mi_ and _-na_ suffixes after _verbs and prepositions_, and _ona_ became _o'_ _before verbs, prepositions, pi li_ and _pli_ (wilemi, wilena, o' li wile)

_sina_ can shorten to _-na_ even _after pi_ (...pi 'na).

### ala

This can be shortened to _a-_ or _al-_ prefix (depends on whether the word-to-be-negated starts with a vowel or a consonant). It can negate _verbs_, _prepositions_, _nouns_ and _adjectives_. The word-to-be-negated cannot start with an _a_! (awile, alunpa) If there are only the negated adjective and ala after a noun, the use of "pi" is unnecessary (hence, "tok' apona" instead of "toki pi apona").

### li

This can be shortened to _l'_ before the predicate (especially if it _begins with a vowel_). It can be done if the predicate begins, or the subject ends with a _vowel_. It can take one of these two position:
1. before the predicate as a _prefix_, if it begins with a _vowel_ (l'olin),
2. after the subject as a _postfix_, if the predicate begins with a _consonant_ (lawal' toki).

Shortening the _li_ before a _shortened ala_ is not recommended (too similar to _la_; you should not do it, unless you want to increase ambiguity), but shortening it before (a not shortened) ala is fine.

As a special case, _pi li_ can be shortened to _pli_ or _p'li_.

### X ni

In X ni structures (where X can be a preposition or the e particle), the _ni_ can be elided, and without ending the sentence, the text (i.e. the next sentence) continues.

For example: _mi sona e ni: monsuta li lon ala_ becomes _mi sona e monsuta li lon ala._

### pi

_pi_ can be dropped when it separates a noun and multiple modifiers connected by _en_ (see: `conjuctions > and > special cases` in the [grammar](grammar.md)).

### Assimilations

A _preposition's_ or a _verb's terminal 'n'_ can be assimilated to the following noun's or subject-suffix's 'n' or 'm' ("tammi" from "tan mi" and "lomma" from "lon ma").

### Time

It is often seen that people shorten _tenpo ni_ as _tenni_. Other variations are also seen sometimes. In these cases, the _ten-_ prefix stands for _tenpo_.

## oke

It can be used as a _general approval_ or like _okay in English_. Should not be used whatsoever! The only possible use of it is only in speech when one does not want think of a real toki pona equivalent, so uses a _tokiponized okay_.

## Use of non-proper names as unofficial words or nouns

Often and internationally used words (the Internet for example) are also can be used as unofficial word, or as a noun, eliminating the restriction that they should also be an adjective.
