## pu

You can check the dictionary that was published in _pu_ on [this site](http://tokipona.net/tp/janpije/dictionary.php). See country names [here](http://tokipona.net/tp/janpije/placenames.php).

These sources were published under _public domain_.

## As I use

These are the word definitions, mostly based on how I use them. Widespread alternative meanings will be also described (marked with _alt_): these alternate meanings are not wrong, though in most cases I do not prefer or recommend to use them. It also includes deprecated, joke and replaced words (under [Older words](#older-words) and [Replaced words](#replaced-words)). The shortened part of speech's meanings will be below the dictionary. See the shortenings of part of speeches [here](#shortenings)!  
I use the country names as they are in _pu_ (or try to guess them as a last resort).

There are three words pairs that are merged in _pu_ ("a/kin", "lukin/oko", "namako/sin"). Many people use them interchangeably; I do not. The definitions will be written under them as under every other word, but I will not mark the alternate meanings, I only left a _see also_ note.

## Phrases, interjections

Some of them may not be understood at first by other speakers. The word _jan_ marks the subject (or the noun of direct address): it can be either _a name (jan X)_ or _sina_. The subject (i.e. direct address) is always at the beginning of the sentence!

_(jan o,) toki!_ -- Hello!  
_mi tawa!_ -- See ya! (said by who comes)  
_(jan o,) tawa pona!_ -- Good bye! (said by who stays)

_(jan o,) pona (mute)!_ -- thank you, thanks  
_(jan o,) pona tawa sina!_ -- you're welcome 

_ike mi_ -- my fault, sorry

_ni/ona li ala_ -- it's nothing, never mind, it doesn't matter

_ale-ali_ -- either way, same thing

_(jan o,) pakala!_ -- screw you!

_ni li..._ -- there is...

_X li pona/ tawa mi_ -- I like/don't like X

_se'?_ -- wut?

### Others

_jan li moku e palisa moli._ -- X is smoking a cigarette.

### Acronyms

These are mostly used in some chat groups and are not well known (with the exception of _tp_), included only for the sake of completeness.

_tp_ -- toki pona (mostly used in English texts)  
_ptm_ -- pona tawa mi (I like... -- Subject shall be used!)  
_omem_ -- o moli e mi (kill me now)  
_tnp_ -- tenpo (mostly to say hours, e.g. 10tnp for 10 o'clock -- 24 hour format should be used)
