# Grammar

The grammar and the dictionary is mostly based on (and 100% backward-compatible with) _pu_, but also extends and tries to clarifiy it based on other sources (_jan Pije's_ lessons, _jan Kipo's_ writings, _common practices_, etc) and my own interpretations as well.

## Word structures and pronunciation

Words and syllables has their own well-defined structure. For the structures I will use the following notations:

- __V:__ a _vowel_ (a, e, i, o, u)
- __C:__ a _consonant_ (j, k, l, m, n, p, s, t, w)
- __n:__ is an _optional n_ (always at the end of a word)
- `*` means _any number_ (e.g. `V*` for "any number of vowels")
- `?` means _one or zero_ (e.g. `V?` for "one or zero vowel")
- `+` means _one or more_ (e.g. `V+` for "one or more vowels")
- `()` for grouping parts

### Letters

Every letter's pronunciation is mostly the same as in [Esperanto](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Esperanto%5Fpronunciation).

_This long description of letters and sounds are from the draft of_ lipu toki pona, _which is a planned toki pona book suitable for learnes as well._

The alphabet has only _14 letters_: five vowels and nine consonants. Alternative pronunciations are allowed due to the small number of consonants.

Vovel  |Sound
-------|-----
`a`    |`[a/ɑ]`
`e`    |`[ɛ/e]`
`i`    |`[ɪ/i]`
`o`    |`[o]`
`u`    |`[u/ʊ]`

Many user tend to use _nasal vowels_ when the consonant is followed by a _n_ (in this case the _n_ may not be pronunced).  
Every vowel is an independent sound and never a diphthong (as, for example, _o_ is often pronunced as `[ou]` in English)!

Consonant  |Sound|Alternative
-----------|-----|-----------
`j`        |`[j]`|
`k`        |`[k]`|`[g]`
`l`        |`[l]`|`[r]`
`m`        |`[m]`|
`n`        |`[n]`|`[ŋ]`
`p`        |`[p]`|`[b]`
`s`        |`[s]`|`[z]`
`t`        |`[t]`|`[d]`
`w`        |`[w]`|`[v]`

The `[v]` pronunciation is considered wrong by some users, but it is sometimes used (especially if the user's native language does not have a `[w]` sound).  
The `[ŋ]` pronunciation is most often used before stop consonants (_k_, _p_, _t_) or at the end of a syllable.  
Even though the `[k`] `[p]`, `[t]` sounds can be pronounced as their voiced counterparts (`[g]`, `[b]`, `[d]` respectively), this is barely ever done in practice.  
The `[r]` and `[z]` sounds are never used normally outside of obvious experimenting or unknown personal reasons.

### Syllables

In most cases, the basic syllable structure is `CVn`, which means it _begins with a consonant_, which is _followed by a vowel_ and there might be an _optional n_ at the end of the syllable. Syllable ending _n_ cannot be used, if the following syllable begins with another _n_!

There are four forbidden consonant-vowel pairs:

- `ji`,
- `ti` (becomes `si`),
- `wo`, and
- `wu`.

There is a rule, that the words may begin with a _vowel_, hence the __ultimate word structure__ is `C?Vn(CVn)*`. Every (official and unofficial) word should and do fit into this structure.

## Unofficial words

Unofficial words or _proper names_ are _transliterations of one's real name_, but there are cases, when someone chooses a new, "random" name. None method is wrong, till the name fit into the already shown structure.  
You should avoid choosing a name that is also an _official word_. One of the possible exeptions is when one is called Ken (there is not a good workaround for such cases).

The proper names are _adjectives_, and usually they are always after a noun (_jan_ for names, _ma_ for countries, _ma tomo_ for cities, etc.). However, when it is obvious what we refer to, nouns can be omitted, especially when this would lead to repetition. The most often seen example of this is _nimi mi li X_, when using _jan_ would make the sentence incorrect (using _mi jan X_ is always preferred). Some examples:

- _nimi mi li Atamo_ (my name is Adam) instead of _nimi mi li nimi Atamo_ -- it is obvious that Sotan is the name, although _mi jan Atamo_ is always preferred.
- (when talking about someone) _ona li Sopija_ (she's Sophie) instead of _ona li jan Sopija_ -- by context it is obvious that the noun is _jan_, although this is unadvised and falls into _gray area_, unless there was at least one previous instance of saying _jan Sopija_ previously.

### Transliteration of proper names

Personal names' transliteration is usually based on its _pronunciation_ rather than how it is written. The followings are _not_ rules, only recommendations and customs:

- the number of syllables should be the same
- the letter `r` becomes `l`, `w` or `k` (depends on how it is pronounced)
- English's `th` becomes `s` (if voiceless) or `t` (if voiced)
- consonant clusters can be either split (like _Solatan_) or reduced to one (as in _Sotan_). 
- vowel clusters should become different syllables (by putting a consonant between them)

It is obvious that there are multiple ways to "tokiponize" a name. For example, the Hungarian name _Zoltán_ could be any of these (list is incomplete):

- _Sotan_ (by dropping the _l_)
- _Solan_ (by dropping the _t_)
- _Solatan_ (by adding an additional vowel to resolve the consonant cluster)
- _Soli_ (based on the nickname _Zoli_)
- _Sosi_ (after _ti&gt;si_ conversion; posibble nickname for _Sotan_, also a version for _Zolti_ which is a usually hated nickname of the original)

For country names, there is another unwritten customary rule: they should not only be unique, but also as distinguishable as possible.

## Word order

The word order is SVO (subject-verb/predicate-object) or SliVeO (subject-_li_-verb/predicate-_e_-object), and prepositions are after the object. The _usual prepositions_ (kepeken, lon, tawa) can be placed right after the subject (but _before li_) as well, although this use fall into the _gray area_.

Adjectives, adverbs (commonly _modifiers_) and possessive is _after_ the head (which can be almost anything besides _particles_).

Since toki pona does not have a _copula_ (like English's _to be_), the predicate can be either a verb or a modifier (as in _ona li suli_ -- he/she is big).

### Modifiers

Depending on what the head is, we can talk about _noun phrases_, _preposition phrases_, etc. For the sake of simplicity I shall write about _noun phrases_ only, but the rules apply to any other phrases as well.

When we have multiple modifiers, the interpretation begins with the _left-most_ one. This modifies the noun and then the next modifier modifies the _modified noun_, and so on. This can be visualized like this:

`N M M M` &gt; `(N M) M M` &gt; `((N M) M) M` &gt; `(((N M) M) M)`

For a practical example:

`jan pona suli mute` (many adult friends) builds up like this:

1. _jan_ (man)
2. _jan pona_ (friend)
2. _jan pona suli_ (big friend)
3. _jan pona suli mute_ (many big friends)


As you can see, the modifier applies to _everything in front of it_. If we want to use multiple modifiers for _one_ as _one single_ modifier (e.g. _suli mute_ for "very big"), then we need to use a _pi_ particle. For example: _jan pona pi suli mute_ means "very big friend".  
The use of _pi_ is explained in (much) greater details [here](#pi).

### Possessors

If we want to express that something is _ours_, we have two ways to go:

1. make a sentence (using _jo_ that means _to have_);
2. add the possessor to the noun phrase.

The former works like it would in almost every other langauges, so we focus on the second case only.

Possessors works as modifiers, but they are always _at the end_ of a noun phrase. As with modifiers, they are separated by a _pi_, usually only when it consists more than one word, but I recommend to use them in every case, since it can lead to ambiguity. As a quick example: soweli mi (my pet), tomo tawa mi (my car), tomo suli pi jan Anon (Anon's big house).  
Some more details can be found under [pi](#pi) about this.

## Separators

### e

_e_ separates the _predicate_ and the _object_. Multiple <i>e</i>s indicates _and_. For example, _mi moku e kili e kala_ means _I eat vegetables and fish_. 

### li

_li_ separated the _subject_ and the _predicate_ (e.g. "ona li moku."), unless the subject is _mi_ or _sina_ only (e.g. "mi moku.", but "mi mute li moku"). Also, multiple <i>li</i>s in a sentence means "and" between predicates (e.g. "ona li moku li tawa" -- she is eating and walking and "mi pilin pona li unpa" -- I feel good and reproduce). Using multiple verbs with the same object is also possible (mi alasa li moli e soweli utala -- I hunt and kill the attacking animal).

It is often seen to use _multiple lis with their own objects_ within a sentence, especially if we want to express _simultaneous actions_. It is a recurring debate this is correct or not. At either case, using multiple sentences with the same subject works out just fine and always the preferred way, although one might want to use a _la phrase_ to indicate simultaniousness (most likely _kin la_). An example would be _mi moku e kili li lukin e sitelen tawa_ (I eat vegetables and watch a movie) vs _mi moku e kili. (kin la) mi lukin e sitelen tawa._ (I eat vegetables. (Also) I watch a movie).

Using multiple <i>l</i>s with _different_ objects are a _gray zone_ use, but unlike many other _gray zone_ structures, this one is relatively accepted and almost always understood.

### la

_la_  separates the context (or the time) and the main sentence. The context is usually a condition, a time or _la phrase_. The _context_ does not have to be a full sentence (e.g. "sina la ni li jan pona" -- for you, there is a friend). If the _context_ is a full sentence, then the _la_ structure means _if/then_ or _when/then_ (mi moku, la mi pilin pona).

Some words before _la_ has special meaning if they are alone. The most often seen example is "ken". These meanings will be shown in the _dictionary_.

Multiple la is also possible, then the main sentence is the _last one_ (e.g. _tenpo ni la mi wile, la mi moku._ -- "now, if I will, I eat", _mi lon tomo mi, la sina ken toki, la mi tu li ken toki._ -- "when I'm in the city and you can talk, we can talk").

Some of the common _la phrases_:

- **ken la:** maybe, possibly
- **kin la:** also, additionally
- **lon la:** really, actually
- **mi la:** for me, personally, I think (not used then the subject is _mi_)
- **tan ni la:** therefore

Sometimes we see writing prepositional phrases (e.g. "lon tomo Putapesi") used in a _la phrase_ too.

### pi

#### General use

_pi_ makes us able to express more complex and abstract thoughts. It is a separator that separates _modifier groups_, thus changing the way how a series of words are interpreted. For example, _jan pona pali mute_ means literally "many working good people" or "many working friends". By adding a pi, it may become _jan pona pi pali mute_ (a workaholic friend) or _jan pi pona pali mute_ (man of many working goodness -- better translation is welcomed).

When it comes to the question of _multiple pi_s, many argues whether it is correct or simply wrong. I see little to no problem with it, we can apply all of our basic rules with practically no changes to make it work and _nothing_ really forbids it. The only thing that needs to be added for them is the general assumption that _modifier groups_ as a whole acts like _single modifiers_.  
Naturally, the _pona_ way is to keep sentences and generally everything else as short as possible, so having <i>multiple pi</i>s is unadvised. Although when we need further clarification, it is often preferred as opposed to using multiple sentences. Ultimately the question comes to this: which way is more _pona_, having one longer sentences with multiple pis, or having more, but shorter and simpler sentences? I am an advocate of the former one, although the absolute truth is that ideally none of these would be needed.

For a quick reminder, modifiers comes _after_ the head (in the examples this shall be a noun) and the modifiers modify the series of words before it, like this:

1. _jan_ (man)
2. _jan pona_ (friend)
3. _jan pona suli_ (big friend)
4. _jan pona suli mute_ (big friends)

#### Modifier groups

With introducing a _pi_, we can separate the different _modifier groups_ (consisting at least one modifier, although having only one word after _pi_ that is not the possessor is useless) that, as a whole, work like individual modifiers.

- _jan pona pi suli mute_ (very big friend)
- _jan pi suli mute_ (very big man)
- _jan pi pona suli mute_ (many-big-good man)
- _jan pona suli pi mute_ (many big friends OR big friend of quantity -- this latter is hard to interpret without proper context, and even then it would be challenging)

By adding more modifier groups, the meaning can be further detailed:

- _jan pona pi suli mute pi pona lukin_ (good-looking very big friend)
- _jan pona pi suli pi mute pi pona lukin_ (good-looking many big friends -- usually "mute" would be the last in this case); same as _jan pona suli mute pi pona lukin_

Using a _single word mofidier_ after a _multiple word long modifier group_ is problematic: it is very unclear what we want to express, so these should be avoided.

Finally let us break down an example and see how it all works out. Our ridiculous example shall be _jan pona mute pi pona mute lukin pi sona mute pi jan Anon_ (Anon's wise, very good-looking friends).

1. **jan** (man)
2. **jan pona** (friend)
3. **jan pona mute** (friends)
4. **jan pona mute pona** (good friends)
5. **jan pona mute pi pona mute** (very good friends)
6. **jan pona mute pi pona mute lukin** (very good-looking friends)
7. **jan pona mute pi pona mute lukin sona** (_sona is part of the previous mod. group, or a new, single modifier?_)
8. **jan pona mute pi pona mute lukin pi sona mute** (wise very good-looking friends)
9. **jan pona mute pi pona mute lukin pi sona mute pi jan Anon** (Anon's wise, very good-looking friends)

Now let us see the same example as a tree graph (head - modifier group - individual words). Note that the meanings apply on to this context!

- jan (man)
    - pona mute (very good)
        - pona (good)
        - mute (very)
    - pona mute lukin (very good-looking)
        - pona (good)
        - mute (very)
        - lukin (looking)
    - sona mute (wise)
        - sona (knowledge)
        - mute (many)
    - jan Anon (someone named Anon)
        - jan (man)
        - Anon (Anon -- name)

**IMPORTANT!**

Naturally, the _pona_ way is to keep sentences and generally everything else as short as possible, so having <i>multiple pi</i>s is unadvised. Although when we need further clarification, it is often preferred as opposed to using multiple sentences. Ultimately the question comes to this: which way is more _pona_, having one longer sentences with multiple pis, or having more, but shorter and simpler sentences? I am an advocate of the former one, although the absolute truth is that ideally none of these would be needed.

#### Possessors

In the usual way though you cannot say _it is mine_. With a minor trick, it is easily expressible like _ona li pi mi_. Usually it is not used, but it was part of official and semi-official grammars for years (in the pre-pu era).

In many lessons _pi_ is used only if there are more than one word after it. I recommend to use pi every time when it marks _possession_ ("ona li tomo pi mi", "ni li tomo pi jan pona"). Since the possessor should _always be_ at the very end of a noun phrase, using a pi is very helpful when the possessor is one word long and not a pronoun.

In _pu_, it is not explicitly said that there must be at least 2 words after pi; instead, it talks about _noun groups_ (i.e. noun phrases, that I would rather call _modifier group_). The word _group_ suggest that it should be at least 2 long, but technically nothing explicitly says that it could not be a _one long group_, i.e. a singe word, which would normally be unnecessary (it does not change meaning), unless we talk about possessors, hence my recommendation to use them in this case.

#### Other uses

It is also often used to express _about_ (mostly along with ijo: _mi sitelen e ijo pi mi_ -- I write about myself).

#### pi li

**This following is deeply in the gray-zone and should be avoided during normal use!**  

_pi_ is (very rarely and wrongly) also used for _relative clauses_ sometimes (mi lukin e jan pi moku e kala -- I see a man who eats a fish): this practice is not recommended and technically incorrect.

I recommend to use _pi li_ for relative clauses, which originates from _jan Sonja_ (the reference would be here, but my request for approval was left unanswered). It can be used after either the subject or the object.  
For (a ridiculous) example: _ona pi li moku e kala li olin e jan pi li moku e kili._ -- They, who eat a fish, love people, whom eat fruits.

Note: this latter use is anything but _pu_ or _standard_. A usual way to express this would be something like this: _jan pi moku kala li olin e jan pi moku kili_. This is very ambiguous (in every meaning of the word) and arguably wrong too.  

_The use of "pi li" and generally the use of "relative clauses" should be avoided!_

## Prepositions

The _usual or traditional prepositions_ are _kepeken_, _lon_ and _tawa_. The words _tan_ and _sama_ often used as prepositions (and _pu_ also defines them so), and sometimes also the words for directions (mostly _poka_). Although _tan_ and _sama_ could and should be next to the _usual prepositions_, traditionally _kepeken_, _lon_ and _tawa_ are introduced in the same lesson, while _tan_ and/or _sama_ are introduced in another one, hence I tend to call only those three _usual or traditional_.  
As a general rule, if there are more than _one word_ after the preposition, a _pi_ should be used! In the case of _locations_, the location word should be seen as part of the preposition (i.e. _lon poka pi tomo mi_ instead of _lon poka tomo mi_).

### kepeken

The usual meanings are _with_ and _use_. Usually it is not used as a verb (if so, it means _use_ as a verb and _with_ as a preposition), although originally _kepeken_ was a verb (and another word was used for _with_ that was removed from the language).

### lon

The usual meaning is _located in/on/at_, and _existing_ as an adjective. It usually does not used as a verb, but it could be with the meaning _to place in/on_ or _to put into/onto/_. _lon_ can also used for _time_ ("lon tenpo ni" -- now), although using a _la structure_ is recommended.

### tawa

The usual meanings are _moving to, going to_ and _for, to_. As an adjective it also is means _moving_, and as a verb it is sometimes used for saying _to move something_.

### tan

Usually it means _by, from, because of_ as a preposition. It also can mean _reason_ as a noun and _to cause_ as a verb.

### sama

The usual meanings are fine (see in the [dictionary](dictionary.md)).

### Direction words

With the usual use, these (_sinpin, sewi, anpa, insa, poka_ and _monsi_) are _after a preposition_ (lon or tawa) and there is a "pi" after these, if it is followed by more than one word, or has a modifier. It is an often seen practice, that these are used as preposition (especially _poka_ for historical reasons); this is not recommended, but if you use them this way (i.e. for _quoting someone using it_), put a comma before them.

## Questions

There are _four ways_ to create a question:
1. repeat the _verb_, _preposition_ or _pre-verb before the verb_ and put an _ala_ between them (sina wile ala wile moku?);
3. put an "anu" into the sentence and mark it with a question mark that it is a question (sina wile moku anu musi?);
2. put "anu seme" to the end of the sentence (sina wile moku anu seme?);
4. use "seme" as the subject or the object (sina wile moku e seme?).

The first two cases will result in a _yes-no question_, while the latter two in an _open question_.

### Answering a yes/no question

To answer of a yes/no question, _repeat the verb_ of the question (with or without the subject) to say "yes", and _say "ala"_ or _repeat the verb (with or without the subject) with "ala"_ to say "no". Alternatively, you can always answer with a full sentence.



## Punctuation

The ultimate rule of punctuation is this: besides the full stop at the end of the sentence and the colon after certain structures, everything is either optional or an alternative.

### Commas

The commas `,` have _no grammatical meaning_, they are only helps to interpret written sentences. These are optional. I often use commas in the following cases and places:

- _before la_, if there is a full sentence before it (mi moku, la mi pilin pona);
- _before prepositions_, if it is not obvious that the word is a preposition or an adjective (ona li tomo tawa mi), or it is not a preposition by _pu_ (ona li tawa, poka mi);
- _before X ni_ structures.

And I do not use comma _before taso when it is a conjunction_. Within _pu_ there is _one_ example, where it is used, although I think it is a much more pona way to end the sentence with a period and start the next one with taso (ona li pona. taso ona li ike lukin).

### Question marks

Question marks `?` are used at the end of questions. See more about questions under [questions](#Questions).

### Exclamation marks

I use exclamation marks `!` in

- imperative sentences (o moku!),
- interjections (moku pona!), and
- after regular, but somehow emphasized sentences (mi wile moku! ona li suli a!).

In both imperatives and interjections the subject is _optional_.

### Colons

Colons `:` are always used in  `X ni` structures, where `X` is either a _preposition_ or the separator _e_.

#### e ni

The closest translation of _e ni_ would be _that_ (as a _conjunction_) in English. I like to think of it as a "placeholder", since it basically renders the next sentence to be the previous/main sentence's object, for example:

- _mi toki e ni: jan li wile jo e jan pona._ (I say that people want to have friends)
- _mi wile e ni: jan li utala ala._ (I want that people don't fight ~ I want people to stop fighting)
- _mi sona e ni: jan pi mute lili li lukin e lipu ni._ (I know that few people reads this booklet)

If we interpret _e ni_ as I described above, in theory every verb that has a direct object can be used with it, although in practice only a handfull is used with it, including _sona_, _toki_ and _wile_. Similarly, if we want to use an _X ni_ as well (i.e. when we want to say something like "I want that people stop fighting, because peace is good"), then the _X ni_ comes after the object/subordinate sentence.

#### X ni

The _X ni_ structures (where _X_ is a preposition) is similar to _e ni_, they both usually translate to conjunctions in English, except we use prepositions instead of _e_.  
This definition however is kind of misleading, since in practice we use only _tan ni_ (because, since) and _sama ni_ (similar to, similarly). I am not aware of any instances of using _lon ni_ or _kepeken ni_. I have seen _tawa ni_ as well for "for", but that seems to be a bit of a stretch, since _tan ni_ covers that meaning and much less ambiguous.

Commas are often used in front of _X ni_ for easier readability.

Some examples:

- _jan li wile utala, sama ni: soweli li wile unpa._ (People want to fight, similarly to how animals want to procreate)
- _mi wile e ni: jan li utala ala, tan ni: utala li ike._ (I want people to stop fighting, because fighting is bad)
- _mi wile e soweli tan ni: soweli li wile e mi: jan lawa ona li pilin pona._ (I want a pet, because they want to keep their master is happy)

### Quotes

I recommend using _double quotes_ `"..."` for quotes to avoid ambiguity with shortenings (where _apostrophes_ `'` might be used) and special uses (like [_jan Lope's lessons_](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jan-Lope/Toki_Pona_lessons_English/gh-pages/toki-pona-lessons_en/index.html) -- this latter is only mentioned for the sake of completeness, it is not widely used and generally unadvised).  
For second level quotes I recommend to use the _guillemet_ `«...»` (also known as _angle quotes_), or when special characters are not available, simply one or two two _angle brackets_ `<<...>>` `<...>`.

### Dialogue

_The followings are experimental, purely recommendations and no rules; there are no official ways to write dialogues in toki pona._

For dialogues, I recommend using _en-dashes_ `–`, _em-dashes_ `—` or _two hyphens_ `--` (if no special characters available). When _en-dashes_ are mentioned, all of the listed alternatives are acceptable; the important thing is that you should use only one of them consistently.

I use the following rules when writing dialogue ():

- En-dash `–`, if the direct dialogue _begins after line break_, or after _dialog tags_ and _actions_;
- En-dash `–`, if the direct dialogue _followed by an indirect dialog_;
- Quotation marks `"` for _indirect dialogue_;
- Quotations marks `"` for _quoting_ (whether within a dialogue or otherwise);
- The line cannot begin with a _dialogue tag or action_. The dialogue tags would come after the last line of dialogue (separated by en-dash) and actions would be on a separate line (along with dialogue tags if needed) between two lines of dialogue.

__Example__ (for the dialogue format, not for the use of the language):

ona li toki e ni: "mi wile tawa weka!" mi sona e ni: jan li apeja e ona.  
-- mi pilin e ni: sina wile pini e toki kalama. sina sona e ni: mi kepeken sina. jan li wile apeja e sina, la jan li wile utala e mi! -- mi toki tawa ona.  
-- pona! mi sona e ni. taso mi pilin monsuta. -- oko ona li telo. -- mi ken pali e seme?  
-- mi sona ala. ike mi.  
ona li awen lili li toki e ni kepeken kalama mute:
-- o nasa ala! sina ike ala.

_The followings are even more experimental._

As an alternative way, in toki pona it is rational that always writing _X toki tawa Y_ is long and ugly. I recommend that especially in conversations between more than 2 people always mark who is speaking with _brackets_ (like _-- (jan Sotan) xyz_).  
Additionally, in this case the noun could be omitted and the rest might be shortened, since normally different _jan_ have conversations (like _(Sotan) xyz_ or _(S) xyz_).   
As an alternative way of writing it, add the name right after the en-dash (without any whitespace) and "close" the name by a single hyphen or an en-dash.
_Do not_ mix these method within a single conversation like they are in the example!

__Example (with mixed signs):__

ona li toki e ni: "mi wile tawa weka!" mi sona e ni: jan li apeja e ona.

-- (mi)  mi pilin e ni: sina wile pini e toki kalama. sina sona e ni: mi kepeken sina. jan li wile apeja e sina, la jan li wile utala e mi!  
--ona- pona! mi sona e ni. taso mi pilin monsuta. -- oko ona li telo. -- mi ken pali e seme?  
--mi-  mi sona ala. ike mi.  
(ona) o nasa ala! sina ike ala.

## Time

These are the _tenpo X la..._ sentences. Time also can be expressed after _lon_. I use the followings for time:

- **tenpo pini:** past,
- **tenpo ni:** current,
- **tenpo kama:** future,
- **tenpo suno:** daytime,
- **tenpo pimeja:** night,
- **tenpo pali:** weekday,
- **tenpo mun:** month,
- **tenpo sike suno:** year (alternatively _tenpo suno sike_ is used as well, but using it is unadvised),
- **tenpo mute:** often, many times,
- **tenpo mute mute:** very often, many many times,
- **tenpo pi mute lili:** sometimes,
- **tenpo (pi) kama lili:** in near future,
- **tenpo (pi) suno pini:** yesterday,
- **tenpo kin:** again (alternatively _tenpo sin_),
- etc (by the same scheme).

When _tenpo_ is used by itself, it often means a _time interval_ and not a specific time (in either case, the exact meaning is context dependent).

I also use the phrase _tenpo la_ meaning "sometimes".

## Numbers

Numbers are _rarely used_ in the language. They work like _adjectives_, but they are never preceeded by _pi_, and they are placed _after_ modifiers and _before_ the possessor.

 In most of the time, this _simple version_ is used and recommended (for amounts):
- __ala__ for _0_,
- __wan__ for _1_,
- __tu__ for _2_,
- __mute__ for _3+_ or _plural_ (unknown amount, but more than 1), and
- __ale__ for _every_ or _countless amount_.

There is also a bit more complex way:
- __ala__ for _0_,
- __wan__ for _1_,
- __tu__ for _2_,
- __luka__ for _5_,
- __mute__ for _20_, and
- __ale__ for _100_.

These ways can be extended with the deprecated __tuli__ (3) and __po__ (4).

For _ordinal numbers_, put the word "nanpa" before the number.

Quick examples are:

- _jan tu_ -- two individuals
- _jan nanpa tu_ -- the second individual
- _jan pona luka tu tu pi jan Anon_ -- Anon's nine friends
- _jan pona tu nanpa wan pi jan Anon_ -- Anon's first two friends (ordinals should come after the number).

If we need to write down huge (20+) numbers, I recomment to write the number down with simple numbers and never even attempt to say them out loud (e.g. tenpo sike suno 2019).

There is no official (or any widely accepted) way to say mathematical expressions. As a personal opinion, numbers should be avoided (besides the _simple version_) as often as possible.

## Conjunctions

With exception of _taso_, no one of these should start a sentence (use _la structures_ instead).

### And

And is expressed in _three ways_, depending on where we want to say it:

1. if it is _between subjects_, use _en_;
2. if it is _between verbs_, use _li_;
3. if it is _between objects_, use _e_.

For example, _sina en mi li wile pali li pali e ijo e ijo ante._

#### Special cases

In special cases, where one would use an "and", but toki pona usually does not give an easy solution for that, I recommend using "en" as it would normally _never_ be in those positions and thus it is easily understandable. This use is **very debatable** and **falls in the gray area**.

As a contraction, _en_ also could be _between modifiers_ too, when two different kind of thing is expressed. Generally it looks like this:  
`N pi M1 en M1`, where _N_ is a noun, followed by a _pi_, _M1_ is a modifier and _M2_ is another modifier. Usually this piece would look like this: `N M1 SEP N M2`, where _SEP_ is a separator. This sould work with _possessors_ too (as _moku pi jan Atamo en jan Sofija_ -- the food of Adam and Sophie).  

It meant to be used mainly in speak (where stress and emphasis helps to make it clear how this should be interpreted)!

__Example__

_jan pi pona en toki_ = _jan pona SEP jan toki_ (good people and talking people) -- the SEP marks that there is an "e" or a "li" or an "en", depends on where it is within a sentence.  
Obviously, if this structure is in the object, it is preceeded by an "e" (...e jan pona en toki). If it is a predicate, there is a "li" (note: it _cannot_ be used after a verb!).

Important, that it does not work with multiple modifiers without _pi_!  
_jan pona toki en ike kalama_ and _jan pona en ike kalama_ are weird and really hard to understand. With one modifier (the original _jan pona en toki_) or with an additional pi (_jan pi pona toki en ike kalama) it is understandable, but only with the right context.

### Or

This is expressed by _anu_. It can be used between either _subjects_, _verbs_ or _objects_ ("sina anu mi li pali", "sina wile anu pali", "sina pali e ijo anu ijo ante"). It also could be used as _en_ between modifiers (see: [Conjunctions > And > Special cases](#special-cases))!

### But

_taso_ is the word you need. I always end the sentence with a period before it (_mi wile pali. taso sina pali_, not like _mi wile pali, taso sina pali_), although it is more of a habit than a rule: _pu_ does not explicitly allows using commas instead of periods before taso, there is one instance where it does that in an example. There were debates whether this is a typo or an interntional use.
If you want to express _exception_, then I recommend to use _and_ and _negative_ (mi wile e ale e ike ala) instead of _taso_ (mi wile e ale. taso mi wile ala e ike). Using _and_ and _negative_ is more compact, shorter, and ultimately more _pona_.

## Difference between a/kin, lukin/oko and namako/sin

These words became merged in _pu_. As most of the speakers, I use them differently:

- _a_ makes a word _emotionally emphasized_ or _exaggerated_, while _kin_ is for _confirmation_ and used as _also_;
- _oko_ means _eye_, all the other is _lukin_;
- _namako_ means _extra, bonus_ and sin means _new, fresh_.

There is another good alternative to use _oko_ as a word, thus making a difference between the meanings of _look_ (oko) and _see_ (lukin).

The definitions above are not full: for the detailed definitions, see the _dictionary_.

## Deprecated words

With the exception of the most known deprecated words (_monsuta_ and _kipisi_), it is recommended to avoid using these _in formal use_. Though I do not think that using deprecated (or even planned) words is a bad thing, especially if they _were not replaced_ (e.g. 'powe' and 'pake' have no obvious counterparts). On the other hand, I would avoid using the _numbers_ ('tuli', 'po').

## Colors

Colors are _jelo_ (yellow), _laso_ (blue, green) and _loje_ (red). Additionally _suno_ is often used for the color _gold_.  
To express the color of something, you can use _kule_ as a noun before them (e.g. _kule kasi_ for green or _kule mun_ for silver).

You can also mix colors using more than one words, for example _laso loje_ for magenta. If there is a dominant color, then put that at the first place and place the other/rest after it.

Many use _laso_ for _blue_ and _green_. I use _laso_ for _blue_ only, and _kule kasi_ for green.

## Sins

These are unforgivable habit that have to end.

### Using "tawa" like it was in English

Sometimes we can see sentences like "sina wile moku tawa pilin pona" (you have to eat for feeling good) or "ona li pali tawa kama jo e ijo" (he works for getting something).  It is __toki pona and not English__. Do not do this. Just do not.

It should be obvious that _tawa_ also shall never be used as a _conjuncion_.

#### Alternatives

Use a _la_ structure (ona li pali, la ona li ken kama jo e ijo, lon tenpo kama), or use _tan ni:_ (if possible) after the preposition and _a subject_ in the following sentence (sina moku tan ni: sina wile pilin pona).

### Using "en" and "anu" at the beginning of a sentence

Starting a sentence with _en_ or _anu_ is wrong. It is against every rule.

#### Alternatives

Use _kin la_ instead of "en", and _ante la_ instead of "anu". In some cases _en la_ and _anu la_ may work too.

## Lesser sins

These are widespread use of words that cannot be prevented anymore (since these in lessons or were official in the past).

### kepeken e

jan Pije's and others', mostly older lessons use "kepeken e" to express the verb _use_. In my opinion it is unnecessary and only gives headache to many people. In most of the cases it is obvious whether one wants to say "use" or "with".

**Removing this one from lesser sins is under consideration.**

#### Alternative

Drop the e.

### Shortening "jan" to "j-" prefix

It is a new phenomenon and seems to be spreading. There is no real problem with it in informal use, but in formal use it is ugly.

#### Alternative

Do not be lazy and write _jan Sotan_ instead of _jSotan_. Thank you.

### Using direct address at the end of a sentence

It is often seen that people put the direct address to the end of a sentence (ni li ijo, _jan Ijosan_) instead of starting with it (_jan Ijosan o,_ ni li ijo).

#### Alternative

Put the direct address to the beginning and use an _o_ after it (additional comma is recommended).
