# Grammar

The grammar and the dictionary is mostly based on (and 100% compatible with) _pu_, but also extended and clarified based on other sources (_jan Pije's_ lessons, _jan Kipo's_ writings, _common practices_, etc) and my own interpretations as well.

## Word structures and pronunciation

Words and syllables has their own well-defined structure. For the structures I will use the following notations:

- __V:__ a _vowel_ (a, e, i, o, u)
- __C:__ a _consonant_ (j, k, l, m, n, p, s, t, w)
- __n:__ is an _optional n_ (always at the end of a word)
- `*` means _any number_ (e.g. `V*` for "any number of vowels")
- `?` means _one or zero_ (e.g. `V?` for "one or zero vowel")
- `+` means _one or more_ (e.g. `V+` for "one or more vowels")
- `()` for grouping parts

### Letters

Every letter's pronunciation is mostly the same as in [Esperanto](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Esperanto%5Fpronunciation).

_This long description of letters and sounds are from the draft of_ lipu toki pona, _which is a planned toki pona book suitable for learnes as well._

The alphabet has only _14 letters_: five vowels and nine consonants. Alternative pronunciations are allowed due to the small number of consonants.

Vovel  |Sound
-------|-----
`a`    |`[a/ɑ]`
`e`    |`[ɛ/e]`
`i`    |`[ɪ/i]`
`o`    |`[o]`
`u`    |`[u/ʊ]`

Many user tend to use _nasal vowels_ when the consonant is followed by a _n_ (in this case the _n_ may not be pronunced).  
Every vowel is an independent sound and never a diphthong (as, for example, _o_ is often pronunced as `[ou]` in English)!

Consonant  |Sound|Alternative
-----------|-----|-----------
`j`        |`[j]`|
`k`        |`[k]`|`[g]`
`l`        |`[l]`|`[r]`
`m`        |`[m]`|
`n`        |`[n]`|`[ŋ]`
`p`        |`[p]`|`[b]`
`s`        |`[s]`|`[z]`
`t`        |`[t]`|`[d]`
`w`        |`[w]`|`[v]`

The `[v]` pronunciation is considered wrong by some users, but it is sometimes used (especially if the user's native language does not have a `[w]` sound).  
The `[ŋ]` pronunciation is most often used before stop consonants (_k_, _p_, _t_) or at the end of a syllable.  
Even though the `[k`] `[p]`, `[t]` sounds can be pronounced as their voiced counterparts (`[g]`, `[b]`, `[d]` respectively), this is barely ever done in practice.  
The `[r]` and `[z]` sounds are never used normally outside of obvious experimenting or unknown personal reasons.

### Syllables

In most cases, the basic syllable structure is `CVn`, which means it _begins with a consonant_, which is _followed by a vowel_ and there might be an _optional n_ at the end of the syllable. Syllable ending _n_ cannot be used, if the following syllable begins with another _n_!

There are four forbidden consonant-vowel pairs:

- `ji`,
- `ti` (becomes `si`),
- `wo`, and
- `wu`.

There is a rule, that the words may begin with a _vowel_, hence the __ultimate word structure__ is `C?Vn(CVn)*`. Every (official and unofficial) word should and do fit into this structure.

## Proper names

Mostly the proper names are _transliterations of one's real name_, but there are cases, when someone chose a new, "random" name. None method is wrong, till the name fit into the already shown structure.

### Transliteration of proper names

Personal names' transliteration is usually based on its _pronunciation_ rather than how it is written. The followings are _not_ rules, only recommendations and customs:

- the number of syllables should be the same
- the letter `r` becomes `l`, `w` or `k` (depends on how it is pronounced)
- English's `th` becomes `s` (if voiceless) or `t` (if voiced)
- consonant clusters can be either split (like _Solatan_) or reduced to one (as in _Sotan_). 
- vowel clusters should become different syllables (by putting a consonant between them)

It is obvious that there are multiple ways to "tokiponize" a name. For example, the Hungarian name _Zoltán_ could be any of these (list is incomplete):

- _Sotan_ (by dropping the _l_)
- _Solan_ (by dropping the _t_)
- _Solatan_ (by adding an additional vowel to resolve the consonant cluster)
- _Soli_ (based on the nickname _Zoli_)
- _Soti_ (posibble nickname for _Sotan_, also a version for _Zolti_ which is a usually hated nickname of the original)

For country names, there is another unwritten customary rule: they should not only be unique, but also as distinguishable as possible.

## Word order

The word order is SVO (subject-verb-object) or SliVeO (subject-_li_-verb-_e_-object), and prepositions are after the object. The _usual prepositions_ (kepeken, lon, tawa) can be placed right after the subject (but _before li_) as well, with an additional comma before them if necessary. Adjectives, adverbs (commonly _modifiers_) and possessive is _after_ the noun or verb!

## Punctuation

The ultimate rule of punctuation is this: besides the full stop at the end of the sentence, everything is either optional or an alternative.

### Commas

The commas have _no grammatical meaning_, they are only helps to interpret written sentences. These are optional. I often use commas in the following cases and places:

- _before la_, if there is a full sentence before it (mi moku, la mi pilin pona);
- _after o_, if it is an interjection or a phrase, and there is a subject (sina o, pona!);
- _before prepositions_, if it is not obvious that the word is a preposition or an adjective (ona li tomo tawa mi), or it is not a preposition by _pu_ (ona li tawa, poka mi).

And I do not use comma _before taso when it is a conjunction_. I think it is a much more pona way to end the sentence with a period and start the next one with taso (ona li pona. taso ona li ike lukin).

### Exclamation marks

I use exclamation marks in

- imperative sentences (o moku!),
- interjections (moku pona!), and
- after regular, but somehow emphasized sentences (mi wile moku! ona li suli a!).

In both imperatives and interjections the subject is _optional_.

### Quotes

Although normally shortenings would not occur, I recomment to use _double quotes_ `"..."` always for quotes to avoid ambiguity with them (where _apostrophes_ `'` might be used).  
For second level quotes I recommend to use the _guillemet_ `«...»` (also known as _angle quotes_), or when special characters are not available, simply one or two two _angle brackets_ `<<...>>` `<...>`.

### Dialog

This is how I write a dialog:

- Quotation marks, if it is an _inline direct dialog_;
- En-dash `–` or two hyphens `--`, if the direct dialog _begins after line break_, or after an _inline indirect dialog_;
- En-dash `–` or two hyphens `--`, if the direct dialog _followed by an indirect dialog_.

I will use the terms "en-dash" and "two hyphens" interchangeably.

__Example:__

ona li toki e ni: "mi wile tawa weka!" mi sona e ni: jan li apeja e ona.  
-- mi pilin e ni: sina wile pini e toki kalama. sina sona e ni: mi kepeken sina. jan li wile apeja e sina, la jan li wile utala e mi! -- mi toki tawa ona.  
-- pona! mi sona e ni. taso mi pilin monsuta. -- oko ona li telo. -- mi ken pali e seme?  
-- mi sona ala. ike mi.  
-- o nasa ala! sina ike ala.

As an alternative way, in toki pona it is rational that always writing _X toki tawa Y_ is long and ugly. I recommend that especially in conversations between more than 2 people always mark who is speaking with _brackets_ (like _-- (jan Sotan) xyz_).  
Additionally, in this case the noun could be omitted and the rest might be shortened, since normally different _jan_ have conversations (like _(Sotan) xyz_ or _(S) xyz_). The use of en-dash is still recommended, but it can be omitted in some situations (not a full conversation, only a short reference, etc).   
As an alternative writing of it, add the name right after the en-dash (without any whitespace) and "close" the name by a single hyphen or an en-dash.
_Do not_ mix these method within a single conversation like they are in the example!

__Example (with mixed signs):__

ona li toki e ni: "mi wile tawa weka!" mi sona e ni: jan li apeja e ona.

-- (mi)  mi pilin e ni: sina wile pini e toki kalama. sina sona e ni: mi kepeken sina. jan li wile apeja e sina, la jan li wile utala e mi!  
--ona- pona! mi sona e ni. taso mi pilin monsuta. -- oko ona li telo. -- mi ken pali e seme?  
--mi-  mi sona ala. ike mi.  
(ona) o nasa ala! sina ike ala.

## Prepositions

The _usual or traditional prepositions_ are _kepeken_, _lon_ and _tawa_. The words _tan_ and _sama_ often used as prepositions (and _pu_ also defines them so), and sometimes also the words for directions (mostly _poka_). Although _tan_ and _sama_ could be (or should be) next to the _usual prepositions_, in lessons _kepeken_, _lon_ and _tawa_ are almost always introduced in the same lesson, while _tan_ and/or _sama_ are introduced in another one, hence I tend to call only those three _usual or traditional_.

### kepeken

The usual meanings are _with_ and _use_. Usually it should __never__ be a verb (if so, it means _use_ as a verb and _with_ as a preposition).

### lon

The usual meaning is _located in/on/at_, and _existing_ as an adjective. It usually does not used as a verb, but it could be with the meaning _place in/on_ or _put into/onto/_. lon can also mark _time_ ("lon tenpo ni" -- now), although using a _la structure_ is recommended.

### tawa

The usual meanings are _moving to, going to_ and _for, to_. As an adjective it also is means _moving_, and as a verb it is often used for saying _move something_.

### tan

Usually it means _by, from, because of_ as a preposition. It also can mean _reason_ as a noun and _cause_ as a verb.

### sama

The usual meanings are fine (see in the [dictionary](dictionary.md)).

### Direction words

With the usual use, these (_sinpin, sewi, anpa, insa, poka_ and _monsi_) are _after a preposition_ (lon or tawa) and there is a "pi" after these, if it is followed by more than one word, or has a modifier. It is an often seen practice, that these are used as preposition (especially _poka_ for historical reasons); this practice is not recommended, but if you use them like this, put a comma before them.

## pi

pi makes us able to express more complex and abstract thoughts. It changes the way how a series of words are interpreted. For example, _tomo tawa suli mute_ means literally "many big moving house", i.e. "many big cars". By adding a pi, it becomes _tomo tawa pi suli mute_ (very big car) or _tomo pi tawa suli mute_ (many big-moving house -- better translation is welcomed).

In the usual way though you cannot say _it is mine_. With a minor trick, it is easily expressible like _ona li pi mi_.

In many lessons pi is used only if there are more than one word after it. I recommend to use pi if it marks _possession_ ("ona li tomo pi mi", "ni li tomo pi jan pona").  
Note: the possessor should be _after_ the modifiers!

It is also often used to express _about_ (mostly along with ijo: _mi sitelen e ijo pi mi_ -- I write about myself).

**This following is deeply in the gray-zone and should be avoided during normal use!**  
pi is also used for _relative clauses_ sometimes (mi lukin e jan pi moku e kala -- I see a man who eats a fish): this practice is not recommended and technically incorrect.  
I recommend to use _pi li_ for relative clauses, which originates from _jan Sonja_ (the reference would be here, but my request for approval was left unanswered). It can be used after either the subject or the object.  
For (a ridiculous) example: _ona pi li moku e kala li olin e jan pi li moku e kili._ -- They, who eat a fish, love people, whom eat fruits.
Note: this latter use is anything but _pu_ or _standard_. A usual way to express this would be something like this: _jan pi moku kala li olin e jan pi moku kili_. This is very ambiguous (in every meaning of the word) and arguably wrong too.  
_The use of "pi li" and generally the use of "relative clauses" should be avoided!_

## li

li is used always, unless the subject is only _mi_ or _sina_ (hence "mi moku", but "mi kin li moku").

## la

la is a separator: it separates the context (or the time) and the main sentence. The context is usually a condition or _ken la..._. The _context_ does not have to be a full sentence (e.g. "sina la ni li jan pona" -- for you, there is a friend). If the _context_ is a full sentence, then the _la_ structure means _if/then_ or _when/then_ (mi moku, la mi pilin pona).

Some words before _la_ has special meaning if they are alone. The most often seen example is "ken". These meanings will be shown in the _dictionary_.

Multiple la is also possible, then the main sentence is the _last one_ (e.g. "tenpo ni la mi wile, la mi moku.", "mi lon tomo mi, la sina ken toki, la mi tu li ken toki.")

## Questions

There are _four ways_ to make a question:
1. repeat the _verb_, _preposition_ or _pre-verb before the verb_ and put an _ala_ between them (sina wile ala wile moku?);
2. put "anu seme" to the end of the sentence (sina wile moku anu seme?);
3. put an "anu" into the sentence and mark it with a question mark that it is a question (sina wile moku anu musi?);
4. use "seme" as the subject or the object (sina wile moku e seme?).

### Answering a yes/no question

To answer of a yes/no question, _repeat the verb_ of the question (with or without the subject) to say "yes", and _say "ala"_ or _repeat the verb (with or without the subject) with "ala"_ to say "no".

## Time

These are the _tenpo X la..._ sentences. Time also can be expressed after _lon_. I use the followings for time:

- _tenpo pini:_ past,
- _tenpo ni:_ current,
- _tenpo kama:_ future,
- _tenpo suno:_ daytime,
- _tenpo pimeja:_ night,
- _tenpo pali:_ weekday,
- _tenpo mun:_ month,
- _tenpo sike suno:_ year,
- _tenpo mute:_ often, many times,
- _tenpo pi mute lili:_ sometimes,
- _tenpo (pi) kama lili:_ in near future,
- _tenpo (pi) suno pini:_ yesterday,
- _tenpo kin:_ again (or _tenpo sin_),
- etc (by the same scheme).

## Numbers

Numbers are _rarely used_ in the language. In most of the time, this _simple version_ is used (for amounts):
- __ala__ for _0_,
- __wan__ for _1_,
- __tu__ for _2_,
- __mute__ for _3+_ or _plural_ (unknown amount, but more than 1), and
- __ale__ for _every_ or _countless amount_.

There is also a bit more complex way:
- __ala__ for _0_,
- __wan__ for _1_,
- __tu__ for _2_,
- __luka__ for _5_,
- __mute__ for _20_, and
- __ale__ for _100_.

These ways can be extended with the deprecated __tuli__ (3) and __po__ (4).

For _ordinal numbers_, put the word "nanpa" before the number. In this case, "pi" is not used before "nanpa"!

## Conjunctions

With exception of _taso_, no one of these should start a sentence (use _la structures_ instead).

### And

And is expressed in _three ways_, depending on where we want to say it:
1. if it is _between subjects_, use _en_;
2. if it is _between verbs_, use _li_;
3. if it is _between objects_, use _e_.

For example, _sina en mi li wile pali li pali e ijo e ijo ante._

#### Special cases

In special cases, where one would use an "and", but toki pona usually does not give an easy solution for that, I recommend using "en". This use is **very debatable** and **falls in the gray area**.

As a contraction, _en_ also could be _between modifiers_ too, when two different kind of thing is expressed. Generally it looks like this:  
`N pi M1 en M1`, where _N_ is a noun, followed by a _pi_, _M1_ is a modifier and _M2_ is another modifier. Usually this piece would look like this: `N M1 SEP N M2`, where _SEP_ is a separator. This sould work with _possessors_ too (as _moku pi jan Atamo en jan Sofija_ -- the food of Adam and Sophie).  

It meant to be used mainly in speak (where stress and emphasis helps to make it clear how this should be interpreted)!

__Example__

_jan pi pona en toki_ = _jan pona SEP jan toki_ (good people and talking people) -- the SEP marks that there is an "e" or a "li" or an "en", depends on where it is within a sentence.  
Obviously, if this structure is in the object, it is preceeded by an "e" (...e jan pona en toki). If it is a predicate, there is a "li" (note: it _cannot_ be used after a verb!).

Important, that it does not work with multiple modifiers without _pi_!  
_jan pona toki en ike kalama_ and _jan pona en ike kalama_ are weird and really hard to understand. With one modifier (the original _jan pona en toki_) or with an additional pi (_jan pi pona toki en ike kalama) it is understandable, but only with the right context.

### Or

This is expressed by _anu_. It can be used between either _subjects_, _verbs_ or _objects_ ("sina anu mi li pali", "sina wile anu pali", "sina pali e ijo anu ijo ante"). It also could be used as _en_ between modifiers (see: [Conjunctions > And > Special cases](#special-cases))!

### But

_taso_ is the word you need. I always end the sentence with a period before it (_mi wile pali. taso sina pali_, not like _mi wile pali, taso sina pali_), although it is more of a habit than a rule: _pu_ does not explicitly allows using commas instead of periods before taso, there is one instance where it does that in an example. There were debates whether this is a typo or an interntional use.
If you want to express _exception_, then I recommend to use _and_ and _negative_ (mi wile e ale e ike ala) instead of _taso_ (mi wile e ale. taso mi wile ala e ike). Using _and_ and _negative_ is more compact, shorter, and ultimately more _pona_.

## Difference between a/kin, lukin/oko and namako/sin

These words became merged in _pu_. As most of the speakers, I use them differently:

- _a_ makes a word _emotionally emphasized_ or _exaggerated_, while _kin_ is for _confirmation_ and used as _also_;
- _oko_ means _eye_, all the other is _lukin_;
- _namako_ means _extra, bonus_ and sin means _new, fresh_.

There is another good alternative to use _oko_ as a word, thus making a difference between the meanings of _look_ (oko) and _see_ (lukin).

The definitions above are not full: for the detailed definitions, see the _dictionary_. 

## Unofficial words

Unofficial words (a.k.a. _proper names_) are usually used as only adjectives, only after a noun. I believe that in many cases the noun is ommitable, especially if it would be repeated or when the noun is in the subject while the proper name is in the object, for example:

- _nimi mi li Atamo_ (my name is Adam) instead of _nimi mi li nimi Atamo_ -- it is obvious that Sotan is the name, although _mi jan Atamo_ is always preferred.
- (when talking about someone) _ona li Sopija_ (she's Sophie) instead of _ona li jan Sopija_ -- by context it is obvious that the noun is _jan_.

For obvious reasons, _do not_ use official words are personal names! (e.g. jan Kala, jan Waso...)

## Deprecated words

With the exception of the most known deprecated words (_monsuta_ and _kipisi_), it is recommended to avoid using these _in formal use_. Though I do not think that using deprecated (or even planned) words is a bad thing, especially if they _were not replaced_ (e.g. 'powe' and 'pake' have no obvious counterparts). On the other hand, I would avoid using the _numbers_ ('tuli', 'po').

## Colors

Colors are _jelo_ (yellow), _laso_ (blue, green) and _loje_ (red). Additionally _suno_ is often used for the color _gold_.  
To express the color of something, you can use _kule_ as a noun before them (e.g. _kule kasi_ for green or _kule mun_ for silver).

You can also mix colors using more than one words, for example _laso loje_ for magenta. If there is a dominant color, then put that at the first place and place the other/rest after it.

Many use _laso_ for _blue_ and _green_. I use _laso_ for _blue_ only, and _kule kasi_ for green.

## Sins

These are unforgivable habit that have to end.

## Using "tawa" like it was in English

Sometimes we can see sentences like "sina wile moku tawa pilin pona" (you have to eat for feeling good) or "ona li pali tawa kama jo e ijo" (he works for getting something). It is __toki pona and not English__. Do not do this. Just do not.

### Alternatives

Use a _la_ structure (ona li pali, la ona li ken kama jo e ijo, lon tenpo kama), or use _tan ni:_ (if possible) after the preposition and _a subject_ in the following sentence (sina moku tan ni: sina wile pilin pona).

## Using "en" and "anu" at the beginning of a sentence

Starting a sentence with _en_ or _anu_ is wrong. It is against every rule.

### Alternatives

Use _kin la_ instead of "en", and _ante la_ instead of "anu". In some cases _en la_ and _anu la_ may work too.

## Lesser sins

These are widespread use of words that cannot be prevented anymore (since these in lessons or were official in the past).

## kepeken e

jan Pije's and others', mostly older lessons use "kepeken e" to express the verb _use_. In my opinion it is unnecessary and only gives headache to many people. In most of the cases it is obvious whether one wants to say "use" or "with".

### Alternative

_Drop the e!_

## Shortening "jan" to "j-" prefix

It is a new phenomenon and seems to be spreading. There is no real problem with it in informal use, but in formal use it is ugly.

### Alternative

Do not be lazy and write _jan Sotan_ instead of _jSotan_. Thank you.

## Using direct address at the end of a sentence

It is often seen that people put the direct address to the end of a sentence (ni li ijo, _jan Ijosan_) instead of starting with it (_jan Ijosan o,_ ni li ijo).

### Alternative

Put the direct address to the beginning and use an _o_ after it (additional comma is recommended).
